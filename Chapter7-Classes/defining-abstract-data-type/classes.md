In C++ we use classes to define our own data types. By defining types that mirror
concepts in the problems we are trying to solve, we can make our programs easier to
write, debug, and modify.

The fundamental ideas
 behind classes are data abstraction and encapsulation.
Data abstraction is a programming (and design) technique that relies on the
separation of interface and implementation. The interface of a class consists of
the operations that users of the class can execute. The implementation includes the
class’ data members, the bodies of the functions that constitute the interface, and any
functions needed to define the class that are not intended for general use.

 
Encapsulation enforces the separation of a class’ interface and implementation. A
class that is encapsulated hides its implementation—users of the class can use the
interface but have no access to the implementation.
 
A class that uses data abstraction and encapsulation defines an abstract data
type. In an abstract data type, the class designer worries about how the class is
implemented. Programmers who use the class need not know how the type works.
They can instead think 
abstractly about what the type does.
